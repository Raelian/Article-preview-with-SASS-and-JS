## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See the social media share links when they click the share icon

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SASS
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript
- Font Awesome

### What I learned

I've gained a better understanding on how to use Font Awesome icons as well as classLists for making toggle buttons.
I've also adopted the BEM metodology in hopes of making my CSS and HTML easier to understand for others.

### Continued development

I intend to expand on my Javascript skills and work on making my code cleaner and easier to read.
